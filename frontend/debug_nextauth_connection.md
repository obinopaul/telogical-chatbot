# 🔍 NextAuth Connection Debug

## 🎯 The Real Problem

You're absolutely right - there's a **communication breakdown** between:

1. **Backend Authentication** ✅ Working
   ```
   ✅ POSTGRESQL-AUTH: Password verified! Login successful
   🚪 POSTGRESQL-AUTH: Sign-in callback triggered
   🎫 POSTGRESQL-AUTH: JWT callback - setting token
   ```

2. **Frontend Form** ❌ Still showing "Invalid email or password"

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

The issue is that **NextAuth `signIn()` is failing due to JWT errors**, even though the credential verification succeeds.

**Evidence:**
```
[auth][error] JWTSessionError: no matching decryption secret
📊 Login result: http://localhost:3000/login  // ← Returns login URL instead of success
```

## 💡 What's Happening:

1. User submits form → `actions.ts`
2. `signIn('credentials', {...})` called
3. **Authentication succeeds** (your logs show this)
4. **JWT session creation fails** (due to secret mismatch)
5. `signIn()` returns login URL instead of success indicator
6. `actions.ts` interprets this as failure
7. Frontend shows "Invalid email or password"

## 🎯 The Fix Strategy

The JWT secret issue is preventing successful completion of the authentication flow. We need to:

1. **Debug the exact signIn() response** (added logging)
2. **Fix JWT secret in Docker environment** (environment variables)
3. **Ensure NextAuth can create valid JWT tokens**

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart Docker** to get new environment variables
2. **Check startup logs** for environment variable verification
3. **Try login again** and check console for detailed signIn() response
4. **JWT errors should be gone** and signIn() should return success

The authentication logic is working - we just need to fix the JWT session creation!
